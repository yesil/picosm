# picosm

picosm is a lightweight state manager inspired by MobX but with a **fundamentally different API**. Do not use MobX patterns — they will not work.

## Commands
- `npm test` — browser-based tests (web-test-runner + Chrome)
- `npm run build` — bundle with esbuild

## How picosm works

Classes are made observable by calling `makeObservable(MyClass)` and declaring two static arrays:
```js
class Store {
  static observableActions = ['doSomething'];   // methods that trigger notifications
  static computedProperties = ['derivedValue']; // getters that are cached between actions

  value = 0;

  doSomething() { this.value += 1; }
  get derivedValue() { return this.value * 2; }
}
makeObservable(Store);
```

Only methods listed in `observableActions` notify observers. Direct property assignment (`store.value = 5`) does NOT trigger reactivity — there are no Proxy objects.

## Key differences from MobX — do NOT confuse these

| What you want | MobX (WRONG) | picosm (CORRECT) |
|---|---|---|
| Make class observable | `makeAutoObservable(this)` in constructor | `makeObservable(MyClass)` called once, outside the class |
| Declare actions | `@action` decorator or auto-detected | `static observableActions = ['methodName']` |
| Declare computed | `@computed` decorator or auto-detected | `static computedProperties = ['getterName']` |
| Mark fields observable | `@observable` or `makeAutoObservable` | Not needed — actions notify, not field assignments |
| React to any change | `autorun(() => ...)` | `observe(target, callback)` |
| React to specific values | `reaction(() => data, (data) => ...)` | `reaction(target, (t) => [values], (...values) => ...)` |
| Connect observables | N/A | `track(target, source)` — forwards source notifications to target |
| Message passing | N/A | `subscribe(target, cb)` + `notify(target, msg)` |
| Lit integration | N/A (MobX uses `observer()` HOC for React) | `makeLitObserver(MyElement)` + `observe: true` in properties |
| Async actions | `runInAction()` inside async methods | Just list the method in `observableActions` — picosm detects the returned Promise |

**Routing:** picosm does NOT use centralized route config like `react-router` or `@vaadin/router`. Instead: `createRouter()` + `router.register(store, { onRoute, toURL, before })` — each store registers itself and owns its URL segment.

## Critical rules for generating picosm code

1. **No decorators** — picosm does not use `@observable`, `@action`, `@computed`, or any decorator syntax
2. **No `makeAutoObservable`** — does not exist in picosm
3. **No `autorun`** — use `observe(target, callback)` instead
4. **No `runInAction`** — does not exist; async actions are handled automatically
5. **No Proxy reactivity** — only calling an `observableAction` method triggers notifications, never direct property writes
6. **`makeObservable` takes the class, not `this`** — called once after the class declaration, not in the constructor
7. **`reaction` selector must return an array** — return `[]` to skip, return `[value1, value2]` to trigger the effect
8. **All subscriptions return disposer functions** — always call the disposer to clean up
9. **Notifications are batched via microtask** — observers fire asynchronously after the current synchronous block completes
10. **`observe` and `reaction` accept an optional `timeout` parameter** for throttling (milliseconds)

## Critical rules for router code

1. **No central route map** — each store registers itself and handles its own matching logic
2. **`createRouter()` takes no arguments** — the router is created clean, stores register after
3. **`router.register` returns a disposer** — always clean up when a store is no longer needed
4. **`onRoute` receives objects** — `{ path, query, hash }` where query and hash are parsed objects, never strings
5. **`toURL` results are cached** — only the changed store's `toURL` is called; URL is rebuilt from all cached results
6. **`router.go` is a property, not a method call** — bound click handler, same reference every render
7. **Stores own the state, URL is a side effect** — components observe stores, not the router
8. **`toURL` can return `replace: true`** — uses `replaceState` instead of `pushState` for store-triggered URL changes (e.g., filters)
9. **`before` is an async navigation guard** — returns `boolean` or `Promise<boolean>`, first `false` short-circuits
10. **`navigate` and `replace` are async** — they await `before` guards before proceeding
11. **Browser back/forward cannot be prevented** — the router detects via `popstate` and pushes the old URL back if a guard rejects

## Architecture
- `src/makeObservable.js` — core: action instrumentation, computed caching, observe, subscribe/notify
- `src/reaction.js` — selective reaction to specific value changes
- `src/track.js` — forward notifications between observables
- `src/makeLitObserver.js` — LitElement integration via reactive controller
- `src/router.js` — store-driven URL routing via History API (separate export: `picosm/router`)
- `src/index.js` — barrel export (includes router)
- Tests are browser-based (web-test-runner), not Node
